    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Hello. I am sure you have an interest in making your very own
       <strong>quesodilla</strong>. Well you are in the right spot! We will
       be going over everything you need to make an <em>Authentic Mexican</em>
       quesodilla. So get your chef hats on and lets make it up!
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken or Beef</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Tortillas</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Tapatio Slow Cooker Packet (optional)</li>
            <li>Pico de Gallo (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>In this process I will take you through the steps 
            to make this quesodilla. I will be using chicken in mine.
            Cooked in the crock pot with a Tapatio mixture. Feel free to 
            use whatever meat makes you happy.
        </p>

            <li>Cook your choice of meet. You can use precooked meat
                from the store or local deli if you prefer, I just happen
                to love this slow cooker packet.</li>
            <li>Once your meat is fully cooked, you can prepare your Tortillas
                by spreading a thin layer of butter across one side. Once that
                is done, you can place it on a pan over med/low heat.</li>
            <li>After you have the tortilla on the pan, add a layer of cheese 
                first to one half of the tortilla, followed by your choice of meat.
                Once that is done cover with more cheese and pull your tortilla 
                over to form a <em>giant taco</em> shape.
