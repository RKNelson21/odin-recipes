            <li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tapatio-Tinga-de-Pollo-Cooking-Sauce-8-Fl-Oz/637957725" target="blank">Tapatio Slow Cooker Packet</a> (optional)</li>
            <li>Pico de Gallo (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>In this process I will take you through the steps 
            to make this quesodilla. I will be using chicken in mine.
            Cooked in the crock pot with a Tapatio mixture. Feel free to 
            use whatever meat makes you happy.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook your choice of meat. You can use precooked meat
                from the store or local deli if you prefer, I just happen
                to love this slow cooker packet.</li>
            <li>Once your meat is fully cooked, you can prepare your Tortillas
                by spreading a thin layer of butter across one side. Once that
                is done, you can place it on a pan over med/low heat.</li>
            <li>After you have the tortilla on the pan, add a layer of cheese 
                first to one half of the tortilla, followed by your choice of meat.
                Once that is done cover with more cheese and pull your tortilla 
                over to form a <em>giant taco</em> shape. 
            </li>
            <li>Increase the heat on the pan to med/high, and continue 
                to cook your quesodilla on both sides until cheese is melted 
                and the tortilla turns a golden color.
            </li>
            <li>After youre done cooking, place quesodilla on a plate
                and add any extras you would like. 
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>And there you have it!! Enjoy this anytime you get
            a craving for a quesodilla!!
