# odin-recipes

In this repo there will be a project to create a web page that will serve for a hub to 3 different recipe pages. In this project you will see everything that has been taught in the introduction to HTML. This will include demonstration of the ability to show text in bold and italics. Pages will include images as well as links (relative and absolute). This is basic HTML and will not include any CSS at this time. 

I am editing now to figure out git.
